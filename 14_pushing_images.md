# Pushing Images

Docker Documentation References:

## Intent

The purpose of this kata is to familiarize yourself with the process of pushing a Docker Image to a shared repository (Docker HUB).

## Overview

In this exercise, we will login, tag, push an image to the Docker Hub repository, and then list out images.

> Please note that the image you push here cannot be deleted via the CLI from the remote repository, you will need to use the tools provided by the repository to remove the image. Also note, [Azure's Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/) does not support delete, so if you push an image there you are stuck with it.

## Kata Steps

### Login

**Command**

```bash
docker login --username rdammkoehler --password *******************
```

> Note: By default the login command logs you into `https://index.docker.io/v1/` however you can specify an alternate server in this location. The configuration of available servers (servers you have used before) is stored at `$HOME/.docker/config.json`

**Output**

```bash
thought:DockerKata rich$ docker login --username rdammkoehler --password *******************
Login Succeeded
```

### Tag the Image

**Command**

```bash
docker tag nginx:alpine rdammkoehler/nginx:docker_kata
```

> Note: the use of mine as a tag is a totally arbitrary value for demonstration purposes

**Output**
```bash
thought:DockerKata rich$ docker tag nginx:alpine rdammkoehler/nginx:docker_kata
```

### Push an Image

**Command**

```bash
docker push rdammkoehler/nginx:docker_kata
```

**Output**

```bash
thought:DockerKata rich$ docker push rdammkoehler/nginx:docker_kata
The push refers to a repository [docker.io/rdammkoehler/nginx]

```

### List Images

**Command**

```bash
docker images
```

**Output**

```bash
thought:DockerKata rich$ docker images
REPOSITORY                                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
nginx                                        alpine              f00ab1b3ac6d        2 weeks ago         15.5 MB
rdammkoehler/nginx                           docker_kata         f00ab1b3ac6d        2 weeks ago         15.5 MB
```

> Note: There is no CLI for deleting an image from a remote repository at this time. So using `docker rmi` will remove the image from your local repository and /or untag the remote image but it does not actually remove the image from the remote repository. In order to do that you need to visit the repository and determine how it works for that specific repo.
